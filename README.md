# React Portfolio
This is my portfolio that uses React technology.

## Description
This is a single-page application portfolio for me (junior web developer).<br>
When you load the portfolio you are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.<br>
When you view the header you are presented with my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.<br>
When you view the navigation titles you are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.<br>
When you click on a navigation title you are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.<br>
When you load the portfolio the first time the About Me title and section are selected by default.<br>
When you are presented with the About Me section you see a recent photo or avatar of me along with a short bio about me.<br>
When you are presented with the Portfolio section you see titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.<br>
When you are presented with the Contact section you see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.<br>
When you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text you receive a notification that this field is required.<br>
When you enter text into the email address field you receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.<br>
When you are presented with the Resume section you see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies.<br>
When you view the footer you are presented with text or icon links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and my profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
